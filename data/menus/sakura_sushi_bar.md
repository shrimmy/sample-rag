## About Us

Sakura Sushi Bar was founded in 2010 by a group of friends who shared a passion for authentic Japanese cuisine. Inspired by their travels to Japan and their love for sushi, they decided to bring the flavors of Tokyo to their hometown. With a commitment to using the freshest ingredients and traditional techniques, Sakura Sushi Bar quickly became a local favorite, known for its delicious sushi and warm, welcoming atmosphere.
