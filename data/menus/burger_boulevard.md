# Burger Boulevard

## Our Story

Burger Boulevard was established in 1987 by the Johnson family, who wanted to bring their secret family recipes to the neighborhood. What started as a small counter-service joint has grown into a beloved local institution, famous for our hand-formed patties and house-made sauces.

Today, we remain committed to quality ingredients and scratch cooking. Every burger is made with 100% Angus beef, ground fresh daily, and served on locally baked brioche buns. We're proud to be part of this community for over three decades and counting!
